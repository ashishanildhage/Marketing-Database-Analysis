# Marketing for Sales Company

## Aim

The aim of this project is to create a Python script that connects to and extracts data from an SQLite3 database based on specified criteria. The extracted data is then stored in two CSV files using both Pandas and pure SQL methods.

## Dependencies

- Python
- SQLite3
- Pandas

## Info

1. The SQLite database file (`Data Engineer_ETL Assignment.db`) as well as the `main_sql.py` and `main_pandas.py` scripts can be found.
2. Two .csv files will be the result after the analysis `marketing_pandas.csv` (using Pandas) and `marketing_sql.csv` (using SQL).

### How to Run
1. Make sure the 3 task dependencies are installed, if not run `pip install pandas` and `pip install pysqlite3`
2. Run the command: `python main_sql.py` and `python main_pandas.py` in the terminal with pwd where the files are located.
3. `marketing_pandas.csv` and `marketing_sql.csv` will be generated.
